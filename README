This is  a companion module  to DateTime.pm. It implements  the French
Revolutionary calendar and decimal time.

INSTALLATION

The simplest  way, of course, is  using a CPAN  client: CPAN.pm, cpanp
(from CPANPLUS.pm) or cpanm (from App::cpanminus).

If you downloaded  the .tar.gz archive, or if you  cloned the git repo
with

  git clone https://github.com/jforget/DateTime-Calendar-FrenchRevolutionary.git

then the preferred way is:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

ALTERNATE INSTALL

This module can be installed on a perl-less computer!

All you need, on this computer, is:
  - tar and gzip, or compatible software
  - a table-aware HTML browser (no Internet connection required if you
  downloaded the archive from a local network or a CD-ROM)
  - a printer.

The installation steps are:

- Gunzip and untar the archive.
- Go to the eg/result subdirectory.
- Open the various files ending in "en.html" (or, if you are a
French-speaker, ending in "fr.html") with the HTML browser.
- Print them.
That's all!
