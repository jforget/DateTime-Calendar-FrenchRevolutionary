<h3>How to convert $gr_date</h3>
<p>Look at the first table. The Gregorian year <strong>$y</strong> belongs to the interval
<em>$begint&nbsp;-&nbsp;$end_of_interval{$begint}</em> and its last two digits are 
<em>$y2</em>. 
The cell in the corresponding
line and column contains the three letters <em>$word</em>. 
<p>Look at the next three tables. 
The month <strong>$labels{month}[$m-1]</strong> appears in the <em>$labels{title2}{$part}</em> table, at
the head of which is the fomula <em>$labels{year_ttl}&nbsp;-&nbsp;$offset</em>.
So you can compute that the French Revolutionary year is <strong>$ryear</strong>.
Of the three letters <em>$word</em>, the letter <em>$letter</em> appears
in the same table. The corresponding cell contains two formulas: 
<em>@formulas</em>. Choose the one that will convert the day number <strong>$d</strong>
into a number in the 1-30 range. That is, up to and including 
<strong>$limit $labels{month}[$m - 1]</strong>, use
the first formula <em>$formulas[0]</em>, and later use the second formula <em>$formulas[1]</em>.
Since the Gregorian day number is <strong>$d</strong>, you use <em>$formula</em>, and you get
<strong>$abridged</strong>. The final step consists in retrieving the day's full name
and the month's full name in the last table, which gives 
<strong>$rev_date</strong>.

$labels{usage2} = <<'EOT';
<h3>How to convert $gr_date</h3>
<p>What about September? The first step is the same, and gives the same three letters 
<em>$word</em>.
<p>But <strong>$labels{month}[8]</strong> 
appears both in the 
<em>$labels{title2}{m}</em> 
table, and in the 
<em>$labels{title2}{e}</em> 
table. The first one gives two formulas for the day: 
<em>$formulas[0]</em> 
and 
<em>$formulas[1]</em> (<em>$mletter</em>
column), and one for the year: 
<em>$labels{year_ttl}&nbsp;-&nbsp;1792</em>. 
The second table gives 
<em>$formulas[2]</em> for the day 
(<em>$eletter</em>
column) and 
<em>$labels{year_ttl}&nbsp;-&nbsp;1791</em>
for the year. 
<p>Try the last formula <em>$formulas[2]</em>,
then the prior one <em>$formulas[1]</em>, then the first one <em>$formulas[0]</em>, 
until you have a result greater than or equal to 1.
<p>For <strong>$d $labels{month}[8] $y</strong>, you would choose <em>$formula</em>,
with the corresponding year formula <em>$labels{year_ttl}&nbsp;-&nbsp;$offset</em>,
which gives you <strong>$abridged</strong>, or better
<strong>$rev_date</strong>.

<h3>How to convert $title_date</h3>
<p>Look at the first table. The French Revolutionary year 
<strong>$y</strong> 
belongs to the interval
<em>$begint&nbsp;-&nbsp;$end_of_interval{$begint}</em> 
and its last two digits are 
<em>$y2</em>. 
The cell in the corresponding
line and column contains the two letters 
<em>$word</em>. 
<p>Look at the next two tables. The month 
<strong>$fr_month[$m-1]</strong> 
appears in the 
<em>$labels{title2}{$part}</em> 
table. Of the two letters 
<em>$word</em>, 
the letter 
<em>$letter</em> 
appears in the same table. The corresponding cell contains two formulas: 
<em>@formulas</em>. 
Choose the one that will convert the day number 
<strong>$d</strong>
into a number in the proper range for the Gregorian month. That is, up to and including 
<strong>$limit $fr_month[$m - 1]</strong>, 
use the first formula 
<em>$formulas[0]</em>, 
and later use the second formula 
<em>$formulas[1]</em>.
Since the French Revolutionary day number is 
<strong>$d</strong>, 
you use <em>$formula</em>. Using the year formula next to the column headers, you get
<strong>$gr_date</strong>.

$labels{usage4} = <<'EOT';
<h3>Special cases</h3>
<p>For 
<strong>$labels{add_days}</strong>,
there is only one formula, which is much simpler.
<p>For 
<strong>$fr_month[3]</strong>,
the cell is split in two, because there are two formulas for the year,
<em>$labels{year_ttl}&nbsp;+&nbsp;1791</em>
and
<em>$labels{year_ttl}&nbsp;+&nbsp;1792</em>.
<p><strong>$fr_month[5]</strong> 
is in both tables. For
<strong>$fr_month[5] $y</strong>,
in column
<em>$bletter</em>
you obtain the 
<em>$formulas[0]</em>
formula, and in column
<em>$eletter</em>
you obtain the 
<em>$formulas[1]</em>
formula. Except for that, everything else is the same. That is, up to and including 
<strong>$limit $fr_month[5]</strong>, 
use the first formula 
<em>$formulas[0]</em>, 
and later use the second formula 
<em>$formulas[1]</em>.
For example, if you want to convert
<strong>$title_date</strong>, 
since the French Revolutionary day number is 
<strong>$d</strong>, 
you use <em>$formula</em>, and you get
<strong>$gr_date</strong>.
