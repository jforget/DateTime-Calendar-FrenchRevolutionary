# When initializing an array with lists within lists, it means one of two things:
# Either it is a newbie who does not know how to make multi-dimensional arrays,
# Or it is a (at least mildly) experienced Perl-coder who, for some reason, 
# wants to initialize a flat array with the concatenation of lists.
# I am a (at least mildly) experienced programmer who wants to use qw() and yet insert

=head1 NAME

DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary::Locale::en -- English localization for the French 
revolutionary calendar.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary::Locale;
  my $english_locale = DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary::Locale->load('en');

  my $english_month_name =$english_locale->month_name($date);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides localization for DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary.
Usually, its methods will be invoked only from DT::C::FR.

The month  names come  from Thomas Carlyle's  book. Most of  the feast
names  come from Alan  Taylor's kokogiak.com  web site,  later checked
with  Wikipedia  and   with  Jonathan  Badger's  French  Revolutionary
Calendar module written in Ruby.  The day names are from this module's
author.

=head1 USAGE

This module provides the following class methods:

=over 4

=item * new

Returns an  object instance,  which is just  a convenient value  to be
stored in a variable.

Contrary to  the widely used Gregorian  calendar, there is  no need to
customize a French Revolutionary calendar locale. Therefore, there are
no instance data and no instance methods.

=item * month_name ($date)

Returns an English translation for C<$date>'s month, where C<$date> is
a C<DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary> object.

=item * month_abbreviation ($date)

Returns a 3-letter abbreviation for the English month name.

=item * day_name ($date)

Returns an English translation for the day name.

=item * day_abbreviation ($date)

Returns a 3-letter abbreviation for the English day name.

=item * am_pm ($date)

Returns a code (typically C<AM> or C<PM>) showing whether the datetime
is in the morning or the  afternoon. Outside the sexagesimal time with
a 1..12 hour range, this is not very useful.

=item * feast_short ($date)

Hopefully  returns  an adequate  English  translation  for the  plant,
animal or tool that correspond to C<$date>'s feast.

Note: in some cases, the feast French name is left untranslated, while
in some other cases, the  translation is inadequate. If you are fluent
in both French and English, do not hesitate to send corrections to the
author.

=item * feast_long ($date)

Same  as  C<feast_short>, with  a  "day"  suffix,  as in  the  current
calendar's "groundhog day" or "Colombus day".

=item * feast_caps ($date)

Same as C<feast_long> with capitalized first letters.

=item * on_date ($date)

Gives a small text about the  events which occurred the same month and
day as C<$date> between the calendar's epoch (22 Sep 1792) and the day
it was rescinded (31 Dec 1805).

Most of these events come  from an anonymous propaganda book published
in year  VIII (1799--1800). The others are  common knowledge available
in any French History book or any encyclopedia.

=item * full_date_format, long_date_format, medium_date_format, short_date_format

Class  methods,  giving four  C<strftime>  canned  formats for  dates,
without the need to remember all the C<%> specifiers.

=item * full_time_format, long_time_format, medium_time_format, short_time_format

Same thing, C<strftime> canned formats for decimal time.

=item * full_datetime_format, long_datetime_format, medium_datetime_format, short_datetime_format

Same thing, for formats including both the date and the decimal time.

=item * default_date_format, default_time_format, default_datetime_format

Class methods  suggesting one each  of the  date formats, of  the time
formats and of the datetime formats.

=item * default_date_format_length, default_time_format_length

While  C<default_date_format>  and   C<default_time_format>  give  the
actual default formats, with C<%> and  all, these class methods give a
one-word  description of  the  default  formats: C<short>,  C<medium>,
C<long> or C<full>.

=item date_formats, time_formats

These  class methods  give a  hashtable where  the key  is the  length
(C<short>,  C<medium>,  C<long> and  C<full>)  and  the value  is  the
corresponding format, complete with C<%> and specifiers.

=item month_names, month_abbreviations, day_names, day_abbreviations

Class methods giving the whole array of month or day names or abbrevs,
not limited to the date implemented by the invocant.

=head1 SUPPORT

Support for this module is provided via the datetime@perl.org email
list. See L<https://lists.perl.org/> for more details.

Please   report  any   bugs   or  feature   requests   to  Github   at
L<https://github.com/jforget/DateTime-Calendar-FrenchRevolutionary>,
and create an issue or submit a pull request.

If you have no  feedback after a week or so, try to  reach me by email
at JFORGET  at cpan  dot org.  The notification  from Github  may have
failed to reach  me. In your message, please  mention the distribution
name in the subject, so my spam  filter and I will easily dispatch the
email to the proper folder.

On the other  hand, I may be  on vacation or away from  Internet for a
good  reason. Do  not be  upset if  I do  not answer  immediately. You
should write  me at a leisurely  rythm, about once per  month, until I
react.

If after about six  months or a year, there is  still no reaction from
me, you can worry and start the CPAN procedure for module adoption.
